# Interview Assignment - Video game involving fantasy creatures:
Let’s develop a game which enables us to create different creatures and perform actions on them.

### Basic requirements
- Creature types are troll and wizard
- There are four core attributes each creature has. Those are strength, intellect, armour and health.
The attributes can hold any value between 1 an 10.
Initially, creatures' attributes are set to random values, except for the troll, whose intellect is always 1.
- Available actions for creatures are attack and heal.
An attack decreases the health of the attacked creature by the value of the strength attribute of the attacker.
Once a creature's health drops to 1, the creature is considered dead and no further attacks can be performed on it.
Only wizards can pefrom the heal action. A heal action, changes the health all the way up to 10.  If a dead creature is healed, it's restored exactly to it's previous state.
- All creatures are having the leadership attribute. It's value can range between -100 and 100 and should be generated based on the values of the four core attributes. A creature with higher core attributes should have higher leadership. Please keep in mind that leadership can only have a positive value once three or more of the core attributes have reached at least 5 as a value.

### Important
- We know it's not easy but try to communicate your thoughts and decisions to the interviewer(s)
- Make sure you test each functionality. TDD is preferable but testing after each functionality is also fine
- It’s not expected that you deliver all of the mentioned requirements. What’s most important is the quality of your
 solution ( think of the clean code principles { YAGNI, KISS, DRY, ...}, SOLID and well tested code)

### Tips:
- Use the language you feel the most comfortable with.
- Feel free to use google or look things up from the existing projects that you've worked on.

### Plus Points ( but only once we're done with the basic requirements ):
- Equipping weapons. If a creature has a sword, the damage it inflicts increases by 2, if a creature has a knife the damage increases by 1
- Implementing persistence layer
